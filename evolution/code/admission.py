"""The admission gate for evolved code.

Phase 4 mutates executable code, which makes it categorically riskier than the
earlier phases. A bad skill edit produces a worse answer; a bad code edit ships
a defect into every agent that loads the tool. So a candidate is not scored on
quality until it has earned the right to be scored at all.

The gate has three properties that a plain "mutate and run pytest" loop lacks.

**It runs nowhere near the real repository.** Checks execute against a
materialised copy of the candidate. The working tree the operator is sitting in
is never the thing under test.

This is a *safety* boundary, not a *security* one, and the distinction matters
because the code being run was written by a model. Credentials and proxy
variables are stripped from the environment, but the process still has the
operator's filesystem access and working network. It protects the checkout from
an accidental bad edit; it does not contain deliberately hostile code. Run
Phase 4 somewhere you would be willing to run an untrusted pull request.

**Ground truth outranks opinion.** Alongside the test suite, the gate replays
commands Hermes actually ran and recorded in ``verification_evidence.db``, with
their real exit codes. A candidate that breaks something a human verified for
real fails, regardless of what the suite says.

**Some checks are sealed.** Visible check failures are returned to the mutator
as feedback, because that is how it improves. Hidden checks are held out: they
gate admission but their details never reach the mutator. Without that split an
optimizer with enough iterations learns to satisfy the specific checks it can
see, and the gate stops measuring anything. This mirrors the train/holdout
split the earlier phases already use for prompts.
